## Getting Started

Set the comma-separated `SKIFF_CONFIG` variable:

```sh
$ export SKIFF_CONFIG=pine64/phone,core/pinephone_manjaro_kde
$ make configure                   # configure the system
$ make compile                     # build the system
```

The `core/pinephone_manjaro_kde` portion of SKIFF_CONFIG enables "Skiff Core"
with [Manjaro KDE for PinePhone].

Once the build is complete, it's time to flash the system. There are several
approaches, please see the "Flashing" section in the [common readme].

## Using Jumpdrive

Flashing using the micro "Jumpdrive" image is useful for recovery:

 1. Download the [Jumpdrive image]. 2. Flash&boot to a SD card: `xzcat jumpdrive.xz | dd of=/dev/sdx`
 3. Connect to PC over USB.
 4. The internal EMMC will appear as a new disk.

The disk now exists at, for example, `/dev/sdc`. Use the [flashing](../)
commands to flash SkiffOS to the EMMC.

## Upgrading Modem Firmware

The phone comes with a older version of the firmware pre-flashed to the modem.
To upgrade the modem firmware, follow the instructions on the [PinePhone
Firmware Wiki] page.

## ModemManager

The SkiffOS configuration includes the relevant udev rules and firmware, but
does not include eg25-manager. ModemManager is included, and can be configured
to connect to a mobile network provider with the [corresponding APN]:

[corresponding APN]: https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_APN_Settings

```
ssh root@pinephone
nmcli connection edit type gsm con-name "My Cellular Connection"
> set gsm.apn myapnhere
> print
> save
```

It should connect to the mobile network, you can use `mmcli` to check:

```
# power on modem, if not already powered
echo 1 > /sys/class/modem-power/modem-power/device/powered
# list modems
mmcli -L
# get modem status
mmcli --modem=0
```

## Known Issues

The following are known issues:

 - Crust/TF-A requires a musl or1k cross-compiler
   - Buildroot cannot build multiple toolchains in parallel
   - Skiff distributes pre-built u-boot binaries to fix this
   - Can re-compile the blobs from scratch with this repo:
