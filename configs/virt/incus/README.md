# Containerized: Incus

This package builds a SkiffOS system for use as a Incus container image.

[Incus] containers are versatile system containers that, as opposed to
application containers like docker, emulate a full init system by default [more
details here] and are therefore well suited for multi service/container
deployments. Incus utilizes the [LXC] APIs internally and provides a powerful
toolset on top of them.

[LXC]: https://linuxcontainers.org/

Building and starting the container requires incus to be installed and running
on the host and the executing user to be in the `incus-admin` group.

## Example

```bash
# Compile the system
$ SKIFF_CONFIG=virt/incus make configure compile
$ make cmd/virt/incus/buildimage
$ make cmd/virt/incus/run
```

Executing a shell in the container:

```sh
$ make cmd/virt/incus/exec
# alternatively
$ incus exec skiff -- sh
```

## Persistence

When using the included command `cmd/virt/incus/run` for creating the container,
a persistence volume will be created in the first incus storage pool available
and attached to the container. If you want to reset the persistence volume, just
delete it, and it will be recreated:

```sh
# You can find the right storage pool with:
# incus storage list -c n -f csv | head -n 1
$ incus storage volume delete "${STORAGE_POOL}" skiff-persist
```
